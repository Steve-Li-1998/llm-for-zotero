/**
 * Receipts for effects a connected client performed inside its own runtime.
 *
 * Codex and Claude Code run their own file changes and shell commands. The host
 * authorizes them — an approval card, or a provider action it dispatched — and
 * then never touches the result: there is no proposal it validated, no journal
 * step it wrote, and no post-state it can re-read on this side. What it can
 * still do is record, in the same vocabulary every in-app effect uses, which
 * catalogued operation was authorized, what it named as its targets, and that
 * the proof stops at "it ran". That is what this module mints.
 *
 * Two rules keep these receipts honest:
 * - `verification` is never better than `execution_only`, because a re-read is
 *   not merely skipped here, it is impossible: the effect happens inside
 *   another process after the host answers.
 * - `executionAuthority` is always `external_runtime`, so the trace says whose
 *   runtime ran it and no reader mistakes it for a host-verified effect.
