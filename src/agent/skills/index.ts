/**
 * Agent Skills — file-driven guidance instructions.

 * Each skill is a native Agent Skill `SKILL.md` file with a concise

 * Built-in skills are bundled at compile time and copied to the user's
 * data directory on first run. The user folder is the sole source of
 * truth — the agent reads only from there.
 *
 * Users can create, edit, or delete skills by managing:
 *   {Zotero profile runtime root}/.agents/skills/<skill-id>/SKILL.md
