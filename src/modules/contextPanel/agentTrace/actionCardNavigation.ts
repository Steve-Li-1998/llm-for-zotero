 * place the reader can go: the paper it tagged, the collection it filed into,
 * the note it wrote, the file it produced. The visit itself is Zotero's — the
 * items pane, the collection tree, the tag selector — and this module is the
 * one place that knows which of those a card object belongs to.
 *
 * The window is reached through a host rather than the `Zotero` global so a
 * test can state the visit it expects without a live pane, and so a card
 * rendered where no pane exists simply has nothing to open.
