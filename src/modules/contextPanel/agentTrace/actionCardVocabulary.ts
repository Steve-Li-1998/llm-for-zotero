 * How the action card draws an operation, declared beside the card type in

 * The reader-facing word is not part of it. `operationLabel()` in the
 * operation catalog is the single vocabulary for naming an operation to a
 * person, and the renderer takes the card's tooltip from it; a second table of
 * words beside the renderer would only drift from the catalog's.
 *
 * A glyph is used only where it says something the object chip cannot: moving
 * (→), adding (+), removing (−), restoring (↺), running (›). Note, file and
 * metadata effects show their chip alone.
