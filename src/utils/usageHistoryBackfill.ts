/**
 * One-time reconstruction of the usage ledger from stored chat history.
 *
 * The ledger (`./usageStore.ts`) only started recording when it shipped, so a
 * user who has been asking questions for a year would open the Usage tab and
 * see an empty panel. This rebuilds the part of that history the database can
 * still prove, and marks every row it writes as an estimate.
 *
 * WHAT IS RECONSTRUCTED, AND WHAT IS NOT
 *
 *   - One row per stored USER message, so the question count equals the
 *     questions actually asked. An agent turn that produced several assistant
 *     messages is still ONE question, exactly as the live path counts it.
 *   - `counts_as_question = 1` for every row. The old schema records no retry
 *     marker, so a historical retry is indistinguishable from a first ask and
 *     is counted once. Live rows keep their honest retry flag.
 *   - INPUT tokens come from the paired assistant message's `context_tokens`,
 *     which is the size of the prompt the plugin assembled -- an estimate, not
 *     a billed count. When no assistant message in the turn recorded one, the
 *     row stays at zero: nothing here invents a number.
 *   - OUTPUT tokens were never stored, but the ANSWER TEXT was, so they are
 *     estimated from it (`./usageTokenEstimate.ts`) over every assistant
 *     message in the turn -- INCLUDING the stored reasoning summary and
 *     reasoning details, because a thinking model bills its hidden reasoning
 *     as output. That is a heuristic, not a billed count, and a turn that
 *     stored no text and no reasoning still scores zero.
 *
 * Everything it writes carries `token_source = 'history-estimate'` so the read
 * layer can say plainly that pre-cutover tokens are estimates on both sides.
 *
 * TWO MIGRATIONS
 *
 * `usage-history-backfill-v1` is the original reconstruction, which wrote an
 * input estimate and a hard zero for output. `usage-history-backfill-output-v2`
 * is the output estimate (`backfillUsageHistoryOutputTokens`), and it RECOMPUTES
 * every `history-estimate` row from the stored text rather than only the ones
 * still sitting at zero.
 *
 * Recompute, not repair, because an earlier build of this pass shipped a
 * text-only estimate under `usage-history-backfill-output-v1`: profiles that
 * ran it hold a non-zero output count that silently omits reasoning, and a
 * "only fill in the zeros" selection would step straight past them. That makes
 * the new number a REPLACEMENT of the old one, so the rule "never lower a
 * non-zero count" does not apply here and must not be re-added: what is being
 * replaced is an estimate this same code wrote from the same unchanged stored
 * text, never a count a provider reported -- `token_source` keeps those out of
 * the selection entirely. A row whose turn can no longer be found, or whose
 * turn stored nothing at all, is left exactly as it was.
 *
 * A fresh install writes both numbers in one pass and marks BOTH markers, so
 * the upgrade never walks a year of history to discover it has nothing to do.
 * The superseded `...-output-v1` marker is never read again and is left in the
 * ledger where it is: it records something that really happened.
 *
 * WHAT IS EXCLUDED
 *
 *   - WebChat turns, by the `webchat_session` catalog flag AND by the
 *     per-message `webchat_run_state` witness (an adopted WebChat turn can sit
 *     inside an ordinary conversation). The live path records nothing for
 *     WebChat, so including them historically would make the two halves of the
 *     ledger disagree.
 *   - Messages whose conversation has no catalog row. Without a catalog there
 *     is no way to check the WebChat flag or attribute a library/paper scope.
 *
 * SAFETY
 *
 * Running this twice would double a year of history, so it is guarded three
 * ways: the conversation-schema-migration marker (once per profile), a
 * module-level in-flight promise, and a per-conversation cutoff that keeps it
 * strictly behind anything the live recorder already wrote. It is wired as a
 * deferred startup task, catches its own failures, and never throws into
 * startup.
