 * Receipts for effects a connected client performed itself.

 * Codex and Claude Code run their own file changes and shell commands; the
 * host only authorizes them. These receipts are what makes such a turn's audit
 * trail as long as an in-app one: the operation comes from the shared catalog,
 * the proof is `execution_only` because no post-state can be re-read on this
 * side, and `executionAuthority` says whose runtime ran it.
