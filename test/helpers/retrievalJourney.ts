/**
 * The retrieval journey: one turn that asks the same question twice.
 *
 * The two material journeys measure what writing costs. This one measures what
 * reading costs, and specifically what a *repeat* read costs: the model asks
 * the same question of the same paper twice in one run, then asks it of a
 * second paper. Nothing about that is unusual -- an agent re-reads a paper it
 * has already read whenever a later step needs the passage again -- so the
 * question is whether the second ask reaches the ranking pass or is answered
 * from the evidence cache.
 *
 * Everything below the tool is real: the runtime, the registry, the
 * `search_paper` tool and `RetrievalService` itself. Only the two seams that
 * would otherwise read a PDF are fakes, and they are fakes that count -- the
 * `candidateBuilder` the service is constructed with, and the `PdfService` it
 * ensures paper contexts through. Those two counters are the measurement; the
 * events are what attributes them to calls.
 *
 * Determinism: the script passes `queryVariants`, which makes
 * `resolveRetrievalQueryPlan` return a locally built plan instead of asking a
 * model for one. Nothing here touches the network.
